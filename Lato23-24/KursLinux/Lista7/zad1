disown: Remove jobs from the table of active job.
disown -h: mark each jobs so that SIGHUP is not sent to the job if the shell receives a SIGHUP

5. huponexit: If set, Bash will send SIGHUP to all jobs when an interactive login shell exits.


SIGHUP ("signal hang up") is a signal sent to a process when its controlling terminal is closed.

If the process receiving SIGHUP is a Unix shell, then as part of job control it will often intercept the signal and ensure that all stopped processes are continued before sending the signal to child processes (more precisely, process groups, represented internally by the shell as a "job"), which by default terminates them.

This can be circumvented in two ways. Firstly, the Single UNIX Specification describes a shell utility called nohup, which can be used as a wrapper to start a program and make it ignore SIGHUP by default. Secondly, child process groups can be "disowned" by invoking disown with the job id, which removes the process group from the shell's job table (so they will not be sent SIGHUP), or (optionally) keeps them in the job table but prevents them from receiving SIGHUP on shell termination.
